Aim: To develop a simple Flappy Bird game using Python's pygame library, where the player controls a bird to navigate through obstacles by jumping and avoiding collisions to score points.

Algoithm:

1. Initialize Pygame, screen, and game variables.

2. Generate initial pipes.

3. In game loop:

   • Handle quit and jump events.

   • Update bird position with gravity.

   • Move pipes and create new ones.

   • Check collision with pipes or boundaries.

   • Update and display score.

5. End game on collision and quit.

Output:

The Python program successfully develops a simple Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library.

Result:

Thus, the Python program to develop a simple Flappy Bird game using Python's Pygame library is successfully completed and executed.
